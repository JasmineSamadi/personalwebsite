              <br>
              <br> In December 2024 I am graduating from Cornell University
              with my B.S. in Operations Research and Information Engineering (ORIE).
              In May I will graduate with an ORIE M.Eng concerntrating in Applied Operations Research.
              <br><br>

              I love taekwondo! Recently I attained my fourth degree black belt
              and became a junior master. Otherwise you can find me playing tennis,

        <p class="modal-description">
          During my summer internship at Bank of America, I was a quantitative analyst intern
          on the US Global Credit Trading Risk Management team.
          <br> <br>
          We oversaw US IG, US HY, EMEA Credit, CEMEA Credit, CLOs, US Distressed,
          LATAM Credit, and LATAM Distressed Desks.
          <br>
          I learned about credit risk management by calculating and analyzing the
          10-day SVaR, 3-year VaR, Financial Crisis, and Rapid Rates Increase metrics.
          Afterwards, I assessed their impact on portfolio risk and trading strategies.

          <br> <br>
          My intern project consisted of an analysis of aged inventory data to evaluate the impact of
          policy changes on internal trends across trading desks, traders, products, positions, and times of the year.

        I first joined WICC as a social director, then transitioned to corporate director.
        Soon, I became VP of Outreach. In this role I organized the middle and high school
      Girls Who Code porgram. We also ran robotics workshops for local Ithaca community.
      Wanting to be more involved, my junior year I became Co-President. In this role
    I oversaw the Community, Operations, Academic, Corporate, Brand, and Outreach teams.
  This consisted of 35 executive board members, 200+ active members, and 2000+ listserv recipients.

<br> <br> I now serve as an advsior to the team!

          classification using regression techniques in Python.
