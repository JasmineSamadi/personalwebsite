            <h2>About Me:</h2>
            <p>Hi! I'm Jasmine, soon to be joining Apollo Global Management as a
              Technical Business Analyst on the Corporate and Corporate Financial
              Systems team. I'm excited about using my data science skills to
              tackle complex problems and uncover the underlying patterns that drive real-world decisions.
              <br>
              <br> I'm currently finishing my degree at Cornell University,
              where Iâ€™ll be graduating in December 2024 with a B.S. in Operations Research and Information Engineering (ORIE).
              I have started a joint B.S./MEng program where in May I will graduate with an ORIE M.Eng concerntrating in Applied Operations Research.
              I am interested in ORIE because it combines the power of data science, mathematical modeling, and optimization to solve complex,
              real-world problems.
              <br><br>

              Outside of academics and work, Iâ€™m dedicated to taekwondo and recently earned my fourth-degree black belt, officially becoming a junior master!
              When I'm not on the mat, you can find me playing tennis, hiking in nature, traveling to new places, and constantly learning about different cultures.
              I believe every experience is an opportunity for growth, and I'm always up for an adventure!

        <p class="modal-description">
          During my summer internship at Bank of America, I was a quantitative analyst intern
          on the US Global Credit Trading Risk Management team.
          <br> <br>
          We oversaw the US Investment Grade, US High Yield, EMEA Credit, CEMEA Credit,
          Collateralized Loan Obligation, US Distressed,
          LATAM Credit, and LATAM Distressed Desks.
          <br><br>
          I learned about credit risk management by calculating and analyzing the
          10-day (Stressed Value at Risk) SVaR, 3-year VaR, Financial Crisis, and Rapid Rates Increase metrics.
          Afterwards, I assessed their impact on portfolio risk and trading strategies.

          <br> <br>
          My intern project consisted of an analysis of aged inventory data to evaluate the impact of
          policy changes on internal trends across trading desks, traders, products, positions, and times of the year.

          This project analyzed the relationship between the Gender Inequality Index (GII)
          and social and economic factors, leveraging Python for statistical modeling and data visualization.
          GII is a composite number developed by the United Nations indicating gender disparity, where
          a GII of 0 indicates perfect gender equality and 1 indicates maximum gender inequality.
          <br><br>
          We examined over 190 countries and explored factors including adolescent birth rates,
          secondary education rates, and UN policies aimed at increasing women's representation in decision-making.
          A Python-based predictive model with a train-test split methodology was implemented to analyze time series data,
          providing insights into trends and correlations.
          <br><br>
          Logistic regression demonstrated that GII is a significant predictor for
          classifying a country's development status.
          Regression analysis revealed that GII has a strong, negative impact on male secondary education attainment and a positive correlation with adolescent birth rates.
          Policies like UN Resolution 2242 were analyzed through time-series modeling,
          by predicting GII data as if these policies were not put into place and comparing them with actual data.

        <p class="modal-description">This project explores biases in hiring processes
          that lead to gender disparity in the workplace, specifically the favoring
          of male candidates, by simulating hiring and promotion practices.
          <br><br>
        We model gender, seniority, homophily bias, and education level as key factors
        affecting hiring and promotion decisions, investigating their independent and combined effects.
        The simulation uses a Markov chain model to track gender distribution across corporate levels,
        with factors such as promotion bias and departure rates influencing outcomes.
        <br><br>
        Our findings suggest that initial gender imbalance, especially at senior levels,
        exacerbates gender disparities over time, and that education can help reduce these d
        isparities even in the presence of homophily bias. The model highlights the importance of
        addressing both gender bias in hiring and the retention of women in senior positions to
        improve overall workplace diversity. Based on the results, we recommend promoting merit-based evaluations and
        focusing on reducing departure rates to foster a more equitable work environment.
